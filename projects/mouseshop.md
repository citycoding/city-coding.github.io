This mouse store was created from scratch to simulate the start to finish process of creating a website and server functionality. I chose to create an online store to sell gaming mice with a simple theme of white and black. This website was run on the ITM Manoa servers that were available to students in ITM352. This was taught by Professor Port as he guided us through the basics of javascript coding to enhance website functionality.

This class also touched on website security and how it can be exploited. This was emphasized on the client level and as such almost all functionality would be handled on the server with the client receiving information excluding information submitted in forms. The mouse store taught me how to use JavaScript in websites to generate invoices, emails, and page designs. I enjoyed my experience coding this project as it taught me alot of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
