My first WOD experience relied heavily on editing one line of code and refreshing my page to see the changes or lack thereof. My first attempt at creating my first HTML webpage took me over 25 minutes of trying to which I restarted. I wanted to fully flesh out each component of my webpage before moving on to the next to make sure that I memorized and had a thorough understanding of what I was doing and why. Using the built in doc EMMET boilerplate was a great help as I used to start my HTML web pages line by line in the past. Using VS code for the first time was also a great experience as the auto creation of closing tags for what I was making was a huge time saver and helper when it came to identifying what specific divisions and text was being used. I did not end up watching the solution and instead used my online resources from my previous attempt to finish it on my second attempt as I only needed an extra few minutes of time that would be quicker on my second try to finish.

My second WOD consisted of formatting and customizing my previous webpage by changing the font, background color, text wrapping, and margins. This also took me two attempts to complete but I had a very positive experience when utilizing css for the first time as it felt structured for each change that I made. All of the coding was straightforward and I only required help from online sources when implementing the font change as I had no idea where to start. After the tricky part of using google fonts to change my header and body text everything was smooth sailing and I completed the assignment shortly after.

The third WOD gave me the most challenge as creating columns of text while formatting in the images and inline text wrap was difficult. Finding out how to create tabs to house the text and images in and spacing them correctly was interesting. For some reason I had to create 4 columns to properly display my intended 3 columns. I am sure there is some reason behind it but I did not push this further as my timer was still running. Inline images were relatively easy as I knew how to “float” objects and I just needed a refresher to fully flesh out my webpage. 

My advice for future WOD assignments is to keep trying and to not be discouraged to use weird or unconventional methods to get to the end result as you might end up learning something new along the way. In the end online resources are your best friend as thousands of people have tried and failed at almost every problem that you run into and their shared experience will help you.
