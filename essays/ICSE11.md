Software engineers often require the help of other people or communities that have dealt with or encountered similar problems that they are facing. The most common forum for discussion relating to developer problems is StackOverflow. Stack Overflow is a forum that is centered around the answering of questions by novices and experts alike to seek help on their problems. Eric Raymond proposed a set of guidelines that detail a “smart” way to ask questions to resolve your problem.  You must search through all available resources first before asking your question so it does not waste your time or the people answering your question. The second step is to use meaningful, specific subject headers. Having a clear message that is grammatically correct and conveys the specific question is essential to getting your message across. The result is a detailed answer that answers the user's specific question and provides greater context.

Put the effort into properly describing the problem along with any disclaimers for improper grammar use if it applies. Include all relevant information and only include what you know and not what you assume or are guessing. For example, a user by the name of Pablo Fernandes has the heading “How do I get a timestamp in JavaScript?” and writes “I want a single number that represents the current date and time, like a Unix timestamp.” This is a clear heading that describes the main question including the coding language. In the [post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/221294/how-do-i-get-a-timestamp-in-javascript) body, he includes a short and concise question that details the format of the date he desires. 

In stark contrast, we can look at a “not smart” way of asking a question. A user named Murali Dharan titled his post “Two different jQuery in one HTML page” with the body text “Two different jQuery on the same page and the page to be included has the newest jQuery.” This question features a title that is unclear and has no real direction toward what is being asked. The body text is not precise or informative about the specific problem and can be interpreted in many ways. Everything about this question can lead to multiple interpretations and answers depending on the author's vague intent. These two questions show the clear disconnect between their approaches to asking questions.
