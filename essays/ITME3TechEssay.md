Having WODs is an interesting concept because it splits class time and do-it-yourself exercises into two different sections. Being able to do self-learning and problem-solving drills the information into your head better than being guided step by step in class. Freeing up class time to focus on more important concepts and applications versus a first time approach and experience on your own is helpful. Building upon some of my prior knowledge on coding has been very beneficial to my competence in coding in various languages.

The browser history six WOD was focused on adding mouseover javascript functions into the innerHTML of our page. I had some difficulty with making the mouseover elements function as intended as I was not familiar with the formatting that I needed to add the function to the images. The implementation of buttons was relatively easy and I encountered no problems there. This WOD taught me how to add certain javascript functions into images and how they can be effectively used in a webpage.

The second WOD I had done was the invoice one. The main functions that we had to utilize had to do with creating and using javascript variables in tables and properly displaying them in a javascript document.write. I had lots of difficulties figuring out how to use a document.write to display an HTML table. I had gone past the DNF time of 40 minutes and I had to use the provided video to find my solution. I had not thought to inspect the WOD page to find the HTML template that we would be using. With those problems solved the rest of the exercise was very easy and the introduction to using variables to display items was fun. Without hard coding values, the flexibility of the calculations was easy to change and move around.

Invoice two centered on adding shipping fees onto the already existing invoice one table. To add in the shipping costs for the different price points I used an “if” loop to calculate the subtotal and correct shipping price for prices under 50, under 100, and over 100 dollars. This was done through if and if else statements to ultimately find the correct shipping price and the addition to the final total amount. After this, all I had to do was paste in the shipping pricing terms in bold under the table and I was done with the WOD.

Smartphone products one with variables WOD featured the use of javascript variables in our mock online store. The use of javascript variables in the document.write functions allowed me to call variables without having to hard code them into my webpage store HTML tags. This was done for the product names, prices, and images. In addition to the modification of the product display we also created a product data javascript file to print out that the variables were loaded successfully in the console when our product display loads.

Smartphone products two challenged us to use loops to print out the same page as smartphone products one. I was surprised at this WOD because everything had been very easy and I had no hiccups during this assignment. Using a for loop to print out my table using an “i” variable to cycle through my products worked very well. The “for” loop uses a “typeof” evaluation to know when to stop as it will know when there are no more "name" plus “i” variables to call. 

My advice for future WODs is to follow the instructions to a tee. I found myself assuming certain ways to solve the problem but reading the WODs more carefully always helped. I think coding is often more simple than what I imagine in my head. Going from function to function in a straight path is a good way to build your way to a goal. This would be my most important takeaway from these five WODs that I have done.
