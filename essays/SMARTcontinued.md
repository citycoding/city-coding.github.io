My first SMART goal is the creation of a mock website to be used in conjunction with a database. A project has not yet come up where the use of databases or storage of information has been introduced. I expect the final project will be run on a server where a “simple database” can be utilized to store data and can be used to output data. I am excited to fuse together my knowledge of databases from other classes to create a project that will meet my SMART goal.

Currently, I am meeting expectations to earn a B+ in ICS 314. The expectation for work in the class is within the margin of error for maintaining my grade in the class. I would like to attend the practice WODs but the times are outside of my availability and as such I cannot attempt them. I have asked if the practice WODs can be released but it has not been approved. Although my request has not been approved I continue to keep up with all out-of-class assignments.

My last SMART goal is the creation of a new website design for the CKS center derived from skills learned from ICS 314. The CKS website primarily uses Beaver Builder which is built on Bootstrap 3 and 4. I hope to contribute more to the CKS website with a greater range of skills that I will learn from ICS 314 for the semester. I am excited to apply my knowledge learned from class in a “real-world” situation that people interact with.
