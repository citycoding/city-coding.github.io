### SMART goal Re-Evaluation
The first SMART goal I set for this class was the creation of a mock website to be used in conjunction with a database. The introduction of React, Bootstrap, React, Meteor, and MongoDB all builds towards creating a mock website. I created a form from a template that stores and allows for the modification of student data information through the implementation of MongoDB. I found the process interesting as React and Meteor have a multi-step process of adding separate components, pages, UI, server, and client to make the website run properly. The use of collections with MongoDB was interesting and fun to learn. For now, we have learned how to integrate basic form submissions into database entries. MongoDB is a noSQL database, which is a non-conventional database. All of these factors contribute to the completion of my first SMART goal for ICS 314.

My second SMART goal is to earn a B+ in the class. I currently have a 99% in the class, so I am currently surpassing my initial goal of earning a B+. I have completed most of the extra credit assignments for the class, and it has greatly improved my grade in the class. I still have not been able to attend the practice WODs for the class. I have not failed any in-class WODsâ€™ since the last SMART goal assessment a few weeks ago. The assignments and my performance have given me confidence that I will accomplish my second SMART goal.
 
My third SMART goal for ICS 314 was to utilize the skills I have learned for the CKS website. I will hopefully learn more about React and how it can be used or implemented to create useful functions. I can foresee a database application for the CKS special collections offered to researchers when attempting to view digital copies. My supervisors and the director of the CKS will have to be consulted to prototype or implement such a function. I believe that the skills I learned in this class will help me create such a solution.
