## UHM Dating App

Authors: Alexander Moshir, Jaira Pader, Christopher Yamada, Cash Baker, Yu Fang Ma, Veronica 

## Overview

Our idea is a UH Manoa dating app focused on meeting new people on campus. Currently, there is no system in place for UH Manoa students to connect with others and pursue relationships. The UHM Dating App will target a select group of students that wish to mingle with other students based on their majors and interests. This is a blue ocean strategy to target a market segment that is not catered towards currently. 

## Mockup Page Idea
Some possible mockup pages include: a landing page, user profile page, matching page, admin home page, chat room, edit user profile page, and filtering of meeting people.

## Use Case Ideas
A new user will go to the landing page, profile creation page, matching page, and chatroom page. 

## Beyond the Basics
Some additional features that can be implemented is filtering people by current classes, one account per UH ID to counter phishing, and link social media profiles.
