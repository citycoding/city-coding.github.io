1. Briefly describe your system (e.g. A store selling Pokemon game cards)

My system is a gaming mouse store that sells three brands of mice.

2. Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?

As far as I am aware there are no notable shortcomings in my system. All requirements have been met and my IR is working.

3. Describe what you are most proud of about your system:

I am most proud of my product display page. I feel like it is clean and presentable and has a great format to display products in. It has many functions built into it like the navigation bar which includes a: home button, drop-down mouse brand list, login indication/log-in button if not logged in, logout button(if logged in), shopping cart icon, and quantity indicator for the shopping cart.

4. Describe what you are least happy with your system:

I am least happy about my server-side coding. I feel as if I can whittle down some of my code by adding a few functions to reduce the amount of code that may be redundant. Although this is not a big problem at the moment it can quickly become one if I was to rapidly expand the offering of products.

5. How was developing this assignment different than assignment #2?

This assignment was very different because of the server-side interaction. Assignment 2 felt very browser-focused when it came to displaying information and functions. Assignment 3 mainly focused on handling lots of server-side interaction to display relatively small amounts of information that required lots of functions to accomplish.

6. When you ran into a problem, what did you do to address it?

When I ran into a problem I tended to draw out my solution. I felt that drawing out a flow chart of how I would solve the problem gave a much clearer picture on how to move forward with my code.

7. Describe what worked well in doing this assignment?

The implementation of my login cookie went well. I had no issues understanding how cookies worked and how I could use them to get to my desired outcome. This was in part due to my meeting with my professor to get a deeper understanding of how cookies work.

8. Describe what did not work well in doing this assignment?

Something that did not work out is my function generation for pages. Since I had to handle a lot more browser data that was being handled on the server I could no longer use functions to accomplish what I wanted. I had to use a lot more “.get” requests to achieve my desired outcome while maintaining the security of the project.

9. What did you learn from doing this assignment?
 
I learned an immense amount of knowledge on sessions and cookies. I had no prior experience with working with such objects and it shined a new light on how other websites functioned. Cookies and sessions provide so much convenience for the website as it does not need to store so much data and it can be accessed by the browser and server when it is needed.

10. If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you change?

If I could go back in time I would start by working out how I wanted to utilize my cookies and sessions. I spent a lot of time figuring out how I wanted to store and use my data compared to the time spent coding. Getting a better understanding of how they differ and in different ways, they can be utilized was essential.

11. Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging

In assignment 3 I spend about 15% of my time thinking about how to solve my problem, 40% of my time writing code, and 45% of my time testing and debugging. I found that assignment 3 required much less thought on how to solve the problem compared to assignment 2.

12. Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself) and explain briefly your rationale for the percentage breakdown. Be sure to include an overview of what specifically you and your partners contributed (e.g. “I worked on the security and my partner 1 worked on personalization”)

I worked alone on this project so I had to figure out how I would manage my time effectively. I had a fun time coding assignment 3 because it taught me how everything I have learned needs to be interwoven to achieve my desired result. I had a really fun time in ITM and I hope to continue pushing forward toward my goal!
