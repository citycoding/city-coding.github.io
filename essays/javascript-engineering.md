## JavaScript
I have had previous experience with JavaScript through my ITM courses with Professor Port and Kazman. In their classes, I had the opportunity to create a website with a JavaScript backend. I see JavaScript as a flexible language that has very useful elements to aid in website functionality. Some of the later JavaScript basics lessons were very helpful in practice and taught me new expressions and functionalities. I had a generally positive experience with the ES6 exercises as they conformed to new standards and helped to simplify code.

I think JavaScript is great for getting your feet wet when it comes to a language that can be done in a browser and no compiler. It is very easy to start and the progression in learning is very linear to utilize. From a software engineering perspective, I can see value in JavaScript. Having a greater understanding of JavaScript shows a new frame of reference when it comes to website applications and development. It is an augment for front-end web development and can greatly increase the usefulness and capability of web applications.

# Athletic Software Engineering

I have learned about athletic software engineering in other classes and it seems to offer great benefits in return for practical skills. Avoiding the “cubicle” software engineering is a decision that may yield different benefits in the workplace or in free time. Exploring the limits of your capabilities while keeping an adaptive structure helps to build soft skills and fluency. The idea of a “flow state” is also interesting to me as book authors mention wanting to achieve a similar state. Having the reader be in a dream-like state and not be “jarred” out of this state is important. I believe this is similar to coding in achieving a state of mind where you can freely explore your mind and write or code the idea forming in your head.

## WODs

I found the WODs to be a great practical use of skills. Being able to come up with a potential solution and code helps to become comfortable with confronting spontaneous problems. I enjoy this style of learning because it adds an element of urgency to be able to code a solution in a set time. Although there is no punishment for going past the DNF time it forces you to not dawdle on certain choices and take action. Often the worst choice in a situation is in-action versus choosing something when it is relevant. I appreciate this style of learning as it forces you to become adept at solving solutions in a certain style and language.
