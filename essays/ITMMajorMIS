When attending WCC I decided to pursue a degree in Information Communication Technology and through this process I found that I had an interest in coding. As I finished my degree I wanted to apply my skills in ICT towards a B.S. in business. This is where my interest in MIS started as it seemed to incorporate aspects of ICT while being in the world of business. This is where my first step into the world of business and my journey in Management Information Systems started.

Reading more into MIS and having some background in coding seems to implement my two biggest interests of business and computers. Having a business of my own opened my eyes to the logistical operations that need to take place in order for everything to run smoothly. This is why I decided to major in MIS as it combines both of my biggest interests.
