### Bootstrap
Frameworks drastically reduce the time needed to create simple changes in a project. The framework I am currently working on is called Bootstrap. Bootstrap is a simple-to-use framework that customizes CSS layouts and styles on an HTML page. Using Bootstrap on an HTML file is as simple as including a few lines of code in the head of the HTML. Once Bootstrap is initialized, there are many CSS classes and style types that become easy to use without a separate CSS file localized in the folder of the host. Bootstrap does not eliminate the use of CSS files, as changes can be made to a separate CSS file that will override the Bootstrap styles. Bootstrap is best used to create responsive pages that are compatible with mobile devices. 

Creating a “sticky” navigation bar is simply done with a few added classes when using Bootstrap. This is super easy and quick when compared to CSS, where it would require making several classes and javascript events. The time needed to create a navigation bar is halved at the minimum, saving a lot of time and space. When you have learned Bootstrap, it acts as a shortcut to customize HTML pages much quicker in the future. The time spent learning will translate to a greater amount of time saved. Pure HTML and CSS are not inherently inferior in any way, but the process is made simple through consistent design.

### Benefits
There are many benefits for software engineers using frameworks. Frameworks bring consistency, documentation, accessibility, and responsiveness to a collaborative project. Consistency of classes and stylistic choices reduces the number of inconsistencies across different pages and sections. Bootstrap in particular has expansive documentation available online detailing different classes and how to implement them. Bootstrap requires no local files as it is loaded online through their hosted servers. Requiring no locally installed plugins reduces the need for additional software or files to properly run and display a page. Bootstrap emphasizes a mobile-first approach that offers compatibility with mobile devices. Their responsive design can easily scale up or down depending on the device and viewport scale.
